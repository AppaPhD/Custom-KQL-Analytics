                "description": "An attacker may use tools like nmap to conduct port scans to discover hosts and services on a network, identifying open ports and the software and versions running on those ports. This type of scan is often used in the reconnaissance phase of an attack to gather detailed about the network's structure and potential vulnerabilities. \n\nThis detection is set to look for instances of a single device communicating with 80+ other devices over the specific ports 22, 445, and 3389 within a 7 day to indicate a potential port scan. \n\n Handling Guidance: If the source IP (LocalIP) is public, take the source IP and enter it in the search bar on MDTI: https://ti.defender.microsoft.com/ to gather any available information about the attacker. \r\n// If the source IP (LocalIP) is private use Nslookup or Axonius to find info about the source host. \r\n// Additionally, if the IP address is determined to be from a legitimate attacker add it to the list of IPs in M365 IOC to block the IP.\r\n// Investigate any login attempts on Target IP. If scan originates from an internal IP determine who the user was and reach out to them to ask why they were conducting a port scan.",
